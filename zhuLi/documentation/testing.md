# Testing of zhuLi
ZhuLi has been tested with automated JUnit tests as well as manual system-level tests.

## Unit Testing and Integration Testing

### Service Layer
The SourceService has been tested to make sure adding and removing sources works, and to make sure it can function as intended both with and without a config.properties file.

### Data Access Layer
The JsonSourceListFileDao implementation of SourceListDao has been tested to make sure it accurately serializes mocked data to JSON and deserializes it back without any mutations.

### Test Coverage
The final coverage of the domain and dao packages was quite high. Most missed lines were due to skipping trivial methods, such as toString. A disproportinately big hole in the coverage of SourceService was left by the bibtex autogeneration functionality. This was simply intended as a little helper functionality without precisely defined "correct behavior", and so couldn't be meaninfully tested. By line count, this made up a significant portion of the service class, so they had a disproportionate impact on the coverage numbers.

## System Testing
The application has been system-tested manually.
Using and not using config.properties to set data location has been tested.
Modifying all fields have been tested.
Generation of bibtex for multiple sources at once has been tested.
An autogenerated bibtex entry for a book was tested in an actual LaTeX project and found to work.

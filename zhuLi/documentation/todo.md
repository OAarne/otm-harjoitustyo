### Necessary
* Switch to gradle and get ./gradlew run to work
* Exclude UI code from test report
* min 20% test coverage
* Get checkstyle working
* Explain how to run zhuLi, (generate jar,) and generate test report in readme
* Have packages make sense, separate UI and logic
* Generate UML diagram of core classes and embed it into architecture.md in documentation

### Extra Credit
* Make a way to generate runnable jar

## Things left to do for week 5 deadline

### Necessary

#### The actual app
* Add a form for adding and editing sources
* Make it possible to redefine where the sources are loaded from
	* Maybe just a dialog box at launch, where the user can feed a path 
* Try to figure out the architechture and package structure better
* Figure out how to link to local files or something
	* Maybe have a designated file where all the files (or symlinks) are loaded from
	* Possivly just have a field with a path, but that pah can also be relative to some set of directories listed in some config file

#### Other stuff
* Make a way to generate runnable jar and add it to readme
* min 20% test coverage
* Exclude UI code from test report
* Keep the hours logged
* Make a sequence diagram of a central part of the program's functionality (making and saving a change?)
* Clean up the readme and add a more detailed user's manual
* Make a release


### Extra Credit
* Generate UML diagram of core classes and embed it into architecture.md in documentation
